Recordings
==========

These are recordings of satellite passes received from the W2PU station.
Partially decodes of the morse code beacons are also availble in the corresponding
text files.

Recordings were made during testing of the w2pu_track program. Receiver
frequency was controlled manually, and audio was recorded using the built-in 
microphone on AG6GR's laptop (since it tragically lacked an audio-in port).
